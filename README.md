  # About The Application:
   Full stack web application usind heroku and JAWSdb. 
   Our team of experts have spent a lifetime enjoying coffee from all over the world. As our travels take us to various countries, we enjoy connecting with the culture through the coffee they enjoy most, or the coffee they find special.

  # Technology

  **1. [JavaScript](https;//javascript.com/)**


  **2. [Css](https;//css.com/)**


   **3. [Bootsrap](https;//bootsrap.com/)** :
   * Bootstrap is a potent front-end framework used to create modern websites and web apps. It's open-source and free to use, yet features numerous HTML and CSS templates for UI interface elements such as buttons and forms. Bootstrap also supports JavaScript extensions


  **4. [MySql](https://MySql.com/)**: 

  * MySQL is a database management system.
    It may be anything from a simple shopping list to a picture gallery or the vast amounts of information in a 
    corporate network. To add, access, and process data stored in a computer database, you need a database management
    system such as MySQL Server


  **5. [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)**:

  * Web Applications : Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and   mobile applications.

  * APIs : With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware, creating a robust API is quick and easy.

  * Performance : Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features.


  **6. [Sequelize](https://Sequelize.com/)** : 

  * Sequelize is a modern TypeScript and Node. js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and SQL Server, 
    and more. Featuring solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.

 
  **7. [express-session](https://express-session.com/)** :

  * Express-session - an HTTP server-side framework used to create and manage a session middleware. This tutorial is all about sessions. Thus Express-session library will be the main focus. Cookie-parser - used to parse cookie header to store data on the browser whenever a session is established on the server-side


  **8. [Dotenv](https://Dotenv.com/)** :

  * DotEnv is a lightweight npm package that automatically loads environment variables from a . env file into the process.


  **9. [Handlebars](https://Handlebars/)** :

  * Handlebars is a simple templating language. It uses a template and an input object to generate HTML or other text formats. Handlebars templates look like regular text with embedded Handlebars expressions

  **10. [bcrypt](https;//bcrypt.com/)** :

  * The bcrypt NPM package is a JavaScript implementation of the bcrypt password hashing function that allows you to easily create a hash out of a password string . Unlike encryption which you can decode to get back the original password, hashing is a one-way function that can't be reversed once done


  **11. [eslint](https;//eslint.com/)** :

  * ESLint is the dominant tool for linting Node. js packages, and can be configured to enforce multiple coding styles


  **12. [nodemon](https;//nodemon.com/)** :

  * nodemon is a command-line interface (CLI) utility developed by @rem that wraps your Node app, watches the file system, and automatically restarts the process


    
  # Instalation:

  * Clone this repository to use this application on local machine, then npm i 


  * To install necessary dependencies, run the following command :

    npm i express, bcrypt, mysql2, connect-session-sequelize, express-handlebars, express-session, sequelize, dotenv,  npm i -D nodemon ( nodemon is not required)
 

  * npm run dev ( to run the app with nodemon)  
    

  * The application will be invoked with the following command: This will start localhost server on PORT 3001*.*

      node server.js


  * Open browser and type http://localhost:3001/

  


  # Features :

  1. Used 'Express.js' to build server

  2. Used mysql to create a database 

  3. Used sequelize to make connection between database and server

  4. Application is deployed on [heroku](https://coffee-from-the-world.herokuapp.com/) : Heroku is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps.
